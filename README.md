You can retrieve your API key by visiting [https://accounts.simplewebrtc.com](https://accounts.simplewebrtc.com).

## Running

1. `npm install`
2. Edit `public/index.html` as described above.
3. `npm start`
4. Go to [https://localhost:8080/](https://localhost:8080)


## Deploying to Static/Shared Hosting

1. `npm install`
2. Edit `public/index.html` as described above.
3. `npm run build`
4. Copy the contents of the `./dist` folder to your hosting location.
5. Ensure your hosting location is served via HTTPS.


## Sound Configuration

Sound effects for peers joining/leaving, messages, and sound output testing can be configured.

Put your audio files into the `/public` directory, and uncomment the desired `<meta />` tags in `/public/index.html`, setting the `content` attribute to the URL of the audio file:

```html
<meta name="simplewebrtc-sound-message-receive" content="/url-of-mp3-file" />
<meta name="simplewebrtc-sound-message-send" content="/url-of-mp3-file" />
<meta name="simplewebrtc-sound-peer-enter" content="/url-of-mp3-file" />
<meta name="simplewebrtc-sound-peer-exit" content="/url-of-mp3-file" />

## Coinbase Commerce
Coinbase Commerce is a business digital payment solution provided by Coinbase that enables retailers to accept crypto payments in various digital currencies. They accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, DAI, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and USD Coin at the time of writing. Coinbase Commerce integrates easily into your online application and eliminates the headache of dealing with cryptocurrency payments.Coinbase and Coinbase Commerce are not synonymous. Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange and wallet manager, whereas Coinbase Commerce is a merchant-facing digital payment service provider.

The Coinbase Commerce API accepts cryptocurrency payments in two ways: Coinbase Charges and Coinbase Checkout.

## Benefits of Coinbase Fees:
1. `highly customizable`
2. `ability to programmatically attach metadata`

## Advantages of Coinbase Checkout:
1. `works out of the box`
1. `dashboard product management`
3. `embedded checkout`

We suggest the Charges API for most applications because it is customizable. This trumps the convenience of the Checkout API. If you're selling a set product and customisation isn't important, you can utilize the Checkout API.

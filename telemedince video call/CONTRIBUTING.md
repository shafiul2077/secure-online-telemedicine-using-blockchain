# Pull requests not accepted

Thanks for your interest in this project. 

We're not accepting pull requests because this is a public fork of a privately managed product, [Talky](https://talky.io), used as a sample app for [SimpleWebRTC](https://simplewebrtc.com).

However...

## Feel free to use issues for questions and help requests

We monitor this repo for new issues, but the quickest way to get a support response from our SimpleWebRTC team is always to [email us at support@simplewebrtc.com](mailto:support@simplewebrtc.com).
